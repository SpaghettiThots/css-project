### [Github Live Demo](https://skofman.github.io/css-project/)

The Introduction to CSS team project assignments provided a platform for very comprehensive interaction between [@SpaghettiThots](https://github.com/SpaghettiThots) and [@skofman](https://github.com/skofman). While this was not our first attempts at collaboration (a previous chapter had us work with other individuals), the *Introduction to CSS* chapter made it possible for us to navigate the various challenges involved with working on projects of any appreciable degree.

First, we determined we needed a plan of action and promptly reached out on <qa.moderndeveloper.com> to [understand how other teams approached their work](https://qa.moderndeveloper.com/t/css-team-collaboration/1627). At least, we could avoid some of the mistakes and pitfalls they might have encountered. We got a fair deal of feedback and promptly set to splitting the work between us. The split was done at every stage in such a way that even while not working on a particular portion, the issues arising ensured that we could only move forward as a team where full awareness of the process is present.

[@skofman](https://github.com/skofman) is really interesting to work with, and except for time constraints because of his day job (a situation that is a common challenge for us), he is very willing to provide assistance and feedback on even the most elementary issues. **He does not give you answers.** He ensures you stay on track until you find a solution. That feeling of nirvana is timeless. Another key issue we had to navigate was timezones. Getting emails at *odd* hours became pretty much the norm which will serve us well in future projects and collaborations.

Again, here's that link to our [live demo](https://skofman.github.io/css-project/).
