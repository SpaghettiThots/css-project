# `<u>`

*The HTML Underline Element (\<u>) renders text with an underline, a line under the baseline of its content.*

In HTML5, this element represents a span of text with an unarticulated, though explicitly rendered, non-textual annotation, such as labeling the text as being a proper name in Chinese text (a Chinese proper name mark), or labeling the text as being misspelled.

## Attributes

This element does not have any self attributes.

## Example

The example below shows the text inside of the `<u>` tag as underlined.

```
        <p>This is a paragraph with an <u>underlined</u> text</p>
```

## Browser Support

All browsers support the `<u>` tag.
